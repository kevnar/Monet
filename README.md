Computer Generated Impressionism in Processing

The program first creats a voronoi pattern using selected color palettes. It then moves the anchor points for the voronoi and updates the pattern dynamically. Using a very low alpha value for the colors, the colors blend and smear, creating an abstract impressionism effect. 

I'm relatively new to Processing. Forgive the spaghettish code and lack of comments. I'm still learning. I'm surprised this turned out as well as it did.
