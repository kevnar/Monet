Computer Generated Impressionism in Processing

The program first creats a voronoi pattern using selected color palettes. It then moves the anchor points for the voronoi and updates the pattern dynamically. Using a very low alpha value for the colors, the colors blend and smear, creating an abstract impressionism effect.
